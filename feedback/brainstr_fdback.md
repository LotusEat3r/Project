Initially, through brainstorming I came up with these possible topics:

1. There are many animal species that are at risk of extinction. Due to limited resources and the potential resource intensity required, which animal species should we focus conservation efforts on?
2. How do different strains of influenza compare across flu seasons? Where do they spread the most? Which are most infectious/deadly?
3. Opinions on vaccination can vary widely. What factors contribute to whether or not a person gets a vaccine? (Probably restrict to annual flu or COVID)

I wanted to explore topics related to health, disease, and survival.

Carson Collins responded by saying that the first idea was interesting, and he appreciated that it was something that could be acted upon.

William Martindale also expressed interest in my topics and asked whether I would be able to find the data to answer these questions.

Evan Miller expressed similar reservations about data collection, and he preferred the second question.


In response to this feedback, I spent time looking for supporting data to see if I could find anything relevant. I settled on looking at influenza information and trying to find data related to my question. I was able to find public data about death rates in the US from influenza and pneumonia, which can be a result of complications with influenza. 

I refined my topic to fit the data I could find. I want to explore death from influenza and how trends have chhanged over a decade. Hopefully, we can see that we are improving in our ability to prevent death from the flu and pneumonia.
